Poverty and HIV have a complex and bi-directional relationship; both are influenced by the same systemic inequalities and power dynamics. Healthcare services, schools and sanitation are often inaccessible for people living in poverty [...]. Poverty disproportionately affects women [...]. Poverty can also be a driver of transactional sex - the exchanging of sex for material goods including food, gifts and cash - which in turn increases the risk of HIV acquisition. Social protection systems, which attempt to reduce social and economic vulnerability of the most marginalized groups, [...] can reduce HIV risk behaviours, as well as improve adherence to ART for adolescents. While cash transfers alone may have some impact on HIV risk, combining cash with 'care' interventions - psychosocial support, such as from parents or teachers - more effectively reduce HIV risk for male and female adolescents. Social protection systems have been shown to improve adolescent health outcomes [...]. There is clear potential for organizations working on poverty reduction to use social protection interventions to support the achievement of [the end of the AIDS epidemics] for adolescents by reducing HIV risk behaviours and increasing treatment adherence.",

According to UN-Water, around 74 per cent of all natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were water-related, and during the past 20 years floods and droughts affected over 3 billion people (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020). Although governments and communities may have developed various measures to reduce or avoid deaths caused by these disasters - such as through improved early warning systems - people's livelihoods might be disrupted or destroyed to a greater extent in the future, with higher human exposure to water-related disasters than other kinds of disasters. This may explain why a significantly positive relationship was observed with respect to economic impacts, but a negative one was apparent with respect to mortality. [...] (UNESCO) estimated that by 2050, population growth in flood-prone lands, climate change, deforestation, loss of wetlands and rising sea levels would increase the number of people vulnerable to flood disaster to 2 billion (WWAP 2012). {Global} --- The significant negative relationship that was observed between economic loss (both direct economic loss and direct agriculture loss) due to disasters and water body extent suggests that economic development may be more susceptible to disasters in areas where water resources are not abundant, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [...] (Shiferaw et al. 2014). In these areas, it may make sense to give more attention to disaster risk reduction and prevention strategies related to drought, for example by adapting existing modes of production to address a higher incidence of water scarcity and by protecting limited water resources. For instance, integrated water management at the basin level can reduce disaster risks and its economic impact, through adopting measures and building infrastructure to retain water surplus. Retaining water surplus helps avoid flooding and can be used during drought periods (UNECE and UNISDR 2018). UN-Water (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020) suggests climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices that could reduce the impact of disasters. [...] The relationship between water body extent and direct economic loss to other damaged or destroyed productive assets was observed to be positive.

Poor sexual health has many of the same structural drivers as HIV, including gender-based violence, inequality and criminalization of behaviours including same-sex relationships, sex work and drug use. Bi-directional integration of HIV and SRHR programmes can lead to increased uptake of services, increased condom use, better HIV testing outcomes and reduction in HIV-related stigma, as well increasing cost-effectiveness. Integration of HIV services into maternal health and family planning services may also be a useful entry point for women.

Exposure to air pollution negatively affects lung growth and places children at greater risk of development of respiratory symptoms including asthma.

[...] Despite the fact that AIDS is a leading cause of death for young people globally, education on HIV is dangerously inadequate. Only 36% of young men and 30% of young women aged 15 to 24 have comprehensive knowledge of HIV and how to prevent it. Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) is a crucial intervention for the HIV response[...]. CSE can contribute to reducing sexually transmitted infections (including HIV) and unintended pregnancy, increasing condom use, increasing self-esteem, and promoting gender equality and more equitable social norms, which in turn can improve health outcomes. We must expand access to CSE, in particular for young women and girls, key populations and out-of-school youth, as this is a key pathway to prevent HIV, reduce HIV stigma and link young people to care and support. Engaging young people in the design, implementation and evaluation of CSE programmes can ensure that material is taught in age appropriate, culturally sensitive ways, which adequately meet the needs of young people.',

[...] HIV programming must understand how gender inequalities influence the HIV epidemic, and how women and girls seek out HIV prevention, testing and treatment services. // Links between HIV and sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR), are widely acknowledged. Poor sexual health has many of the same structural drivers as HIV, including gender-based violence, inequality and criminalization of behaviours including same-sex relationships, sex work and drug use. Bi-directional integration of HIV and SRHR programmes can lead to increased uptake of services, increased condom use, better HIV testing outcomes and reduction in HIV-related stigma, as well increasing cost-effectiveness. Integration of HIV services into maternal health and family planning services may also be a useful entry point for women. For young people, integrating HIV and SRHR services has been shown to improve health outcomes due to increased uptake of services, the ability to access multiple services at one time, and improved healthcare provider attitudes.',

          "Data regarding the 274 remote Indigenous communities in Western Australia indicated that the quality of drinking water supplied to some communities did not meet Australian standards approximately 30% of the time. Further, E. coli and/or Naegleria microbes were detected in at least one community each month over a two-year monitoring period, indicating faecal contamina-tion of the drinking water. The microbial water-borne disease, Cryptosporidiosis, was found to be disproportionately high in remote Indigenous communities, compared to the non-Indigenous urban population in Western Australia. Other enteric pathogens identified in contaminated water in remote Indigenous communities include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, E. coli and Rotavirus. {Indigenous Australia} --- Soil-transmitted helminthiases (STH) infection risk factors involve those living in poverty and the associated lack of access to clean water and toilets, which contribute to unhygienic practices. In Australia, STH [...] are endemic in some Indigenous communities [...]. The worm can contribute to mortality and morbidity, particularly in immune-suppressed patients, but the cycle of infection is effectively disrupted by the introduction of sewerage systems. Trachoma eye infection remains in some of Australia's Indigenous communities [...] Infection is correlated with a range of WASH-related factors including limited access to clean water [...]. It is caused by a bacterium that inflames the eye, and recurrent infections cause scarring of the eye and structural changes to the eyelid that can result in blindness. [...] The presence of both trachoma and skin infections are indicative of the ongoing need to provide sustainable washing facilities. {Indigenous Australia}",

A key contributor to scabies and other skin infections in remote Indigenous populations has been noted to be residential over-crowding [...].

In Australia, STH [...] are endemic in some Indigenous communities [...]. The worm can contribute to mortality and morbidity, particularly in immune-suppressed patients, but the cycle of infection is effectively disrupted by the introduction of sewerage systems. Trachoma eye infection remains in some of Australia's Indigenous communities [...] Infection is correlated with a range of WASH-related factors including irregular washing [...] and crowded housing. It is caused by a bacterium that inflames the eye, and recurrent infections cause scarring of the eye and structural changes to the eyelid that can result in blindness. [...] Chronic infections in early childhood are often linked to vulnerability to other diseases in later life. [...] The presence of both trachoma and skin infections are indicative of the ongoing need to provide sustainable washing facilities. {Indigenous Australia} --- A significant impact on sanitation and hygiene in remote communities is domestic over-crowding. [...] Significant crowding limits the ability of individuals to maintain personal and environmental hygiene conditions that can negatively affect health [...] 28% were living in a dwelling in which one or more of the facilities for washing people, clothes and bedding, for safely removing waste, and/or for enabling the safe storage and cooking of food was not available or did not work. Regarding the ability to wash hands, faces and bodies with soap and water to prevent such infections as trachoma, very few households in Central Australian remote communities were found to possess soap on a regular basis [...] crowding impacts on 'health hardware', the housing infrastructure that enables the washing of people and clothes, and enables safe preparation of food. {Indigenous Australia}",

[...] The presence of both trachoma and skin infections are indicative of the ongoing need to provide sustainable washing facilities. {Indigenous Australia} --- Sanitation has improved with the increasing installation of centralised wastewater treatment replacing onsite septic tanks, yet concerns remain regarding contamination and poor maintenance: In 2006, the majority of remote Aboriginal communities relied on septic tanks as their main sewerage system, while a smaller number used pit toilets and a handful of communities did not have any organised sewerage system. This has now changed following the implementation of state- and territory-funded programmes [...] Despite the improvement of these wastewater services, there has been evidence of poor maintenance of wastewater treatment facilities. For example, a 2015 audit from Western Australia noted a high rate of communities that did not meet national standards-with reported drinking water contamination from sewage-derived E. coli or Naegleria sp. microbes at least once in 68 communities in the two-year period of reporting. {Indigenous Australia}",

          "The significantly negative relationship observed [...] may reflect that most countries are better at reducing deaths in water-related disasters than other types of disasters. // Humans are prone to living and working in water-rich areas, which leads to higher human exposure to water-related disasters. According to UN-Water, around 74 per cent of all natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were water-related, and during the past 20 years floods and droughts affected over 3 billion people (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020). Although governments and communities may have developed various measures to reduce or avoid deaths caused by these disasters - such as through improved early warning systems - people's livelihoods might be disrupted or destroyed to a greater extent in the future, with higher human exposure to water-related disasters than other kinds of disasters. This may explain why a significantly positive relationship was observed with respect to economic impacts, but a negative one was apparent with respect to mortality. [...] (UNESCO) estimated that by 2050, population growth in flood-prone lands, climate change, deforestation, loss of wetlands and rising sea levels would increase the number of people vulnerable to flood disaster to 2 billion (WWAP 2012). {Global} --- The significant negative relationship that was observed between economic loss (both direct economic loss and direct agriculture loss) due to disasters and water body extent suggests that economic development may be more susceptible to disasters in areas where water resources are not abundant, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [...] (Shiferaw et al. 2014). In these areas, it may make sense to give more attention to disaster risk reduction and prevention strategies related to drought, for example by adapting existing modes of production to address a higher incidence of water scarcity and by protecting limited water resources. For instance, integrated water management at the basin level can reduce disaster risks and its economic impact, through adopting measures and building infrastructure to retain water surplus. Retaining water surplus helps avoid flooding and can be used during drought periods (UNECE and UNISDR 2018). UN-Water (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020) suggests climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices that could reduce the impact of disasters. [...] The relationship between water body extent and direct economic loss to other damaged or destroyed productive assets was observed to be positive. This may be due to the fact that productive assets are prone to be located near to water-abundant areas to reduce production costs. {Global}",

          'Positive relationship between DMC of crops, fossil fuels and metal ores and the extent of water ecosystems. This is unexpected, as an increase in the harvest of crops as well as in the extraction of fossil fuels and metal ores most likely goes hand in hand with an increase in water use (Nair and Timms 2020). As a consequence, pressure on water ecosystems rises (Lutter et al. 2016). Excessive use of artificial fertilizers leading to eutrophication (Daniel, Sharpley and Lemunyon 1998) and mineral extraction through unknown fracking fluids (Howarth, Ingraffea and Engelder 2011) are the primary stressors of water ecosystems, both freshwater and marine. However, it is not only the use of water for the extraction processes, but also the expansion of extraction areas such as fields or mining sites, that come at the cost of other types of land cover, such as water ecosystems (Tost et al. 2018). A positive correlation would signify the contrary. The only scenario where this could be the case is when extraction is outsourced to other countries and more goods are imported, since fossil fuels and metal ores are not naturally available in all countries, as by that means less pressure is put on the domestic water resources. Interestingly, no correlation has been identified between water ecosystems and the DMC of non-metallic minerals. Non-metallic minerals are dominated by bulk materials such as sand and gravel, which require considerable area and often signify a considerable impact on the environment. Hence, a similar correlation as in the case of metals could have been expected.',

          "The significantly negative relationship observed [...] may reflect that most countries are better at reducing deaths in water-related disasters than other types of disasters. // Humans are prone to living and working in water-rich areas, which leads to higher human exposure to water-related disasters. According to UN-Water, around 74 per cent of all natural disasters between 2001 and 2018 were water-related, and during the past 20 years floods and droughts affected over 3 billion people (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020). Although governments and communities may have developed various measures to reduce or avoid deaths caused by these disasters - such as through improved early warning systems - people's livelihoods might be disrupted or destroyed to a greater extent in the future, with higher human exposure to water-related disasters than other kinds of disasters. This may explain why a significantly positive relationship was observed with respect to economic impacts, but a negative one was apparent with respect to mortality. [...] (UNESCO) estimated that by 2050, population growth in flood-prone lands, climate change, deforestation, loss of wetlands and rising sea levels would increase the number of people vulnerable to flood disaster to 2 billion (WWAP 2012). {Global} --- The significant negative relationship that was observed between economic loss (both direct economic loss and direct agriculture loss) due to disasters and water body extent suggests that economic development may be more susceptible to disasters in areas where water resources are not abundant, such as in sub-Saharan Africa [...] (Shiferaw et al. 2014). In these areas, it may make sense to give more attention to disaster risk reduction and prevention strategies related to drought, for example by adapting existing modes of production to address a higher incidence of water scarcity and by protecting limited water resources. For instance, integrated water management at the basin level can reduce disaster risks and its economic impact, through adopting measures and building infrastructure to retain water surplus. Retaining water surplus helps avoid flooding and can be used during drought periods (UNECE and UNISDR 2018). UN-Water (UNESCO and UN-Water 2020) suggests climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices that could reduce the impact of disasters. [...] The relationship between water body extent and direct economic loss to other damaged or destroyed productive assets was observed to be positive. This may be due to the fact that productive assets are prone to be located near to water-abundant areas to reduce production costs. {Global}",

          'Positive relationship between DMC of crops, fossil fuels and metal ores and the extent of water ecosystems. This is unexpected, as an increase in the harvest of crops as well as in the extraction of fossil fuels and metal ores most likely goes hand in hand with an increase in water use (Nair and Timms 2020). As a consequence, pressure on water ecosystems rises (Lutter et al. 2016). Excessive use of artificial fertilizers leading to eutrophication (Daniel, Sharpley and Lemunyon 1998) and mineral extraction through unknown fracking fluids (Howarth, Ingraffea and Engelder 2011) are the primary stressors of water ecosystems, both freshwater and marine. However, it is not only the use of water for the extraction processes, but also the expansion of extraction areas such as fields or mining sites, that come at the cost of other types of land cover, such as water ecosystems (Tost et al. 2018). A positive correlation would signify the contrary. The only scenario where this could be the case is when extraction is outsourced to other countries and more goods are imported, since fossil fuels and metal ores are not naturally available in all countries, as by that means less pressure is put on the domestic water resources. Interestingly, no correlation has been identified between water ecosystems and the DMC of non-metallic minerals. Non-metallic minerals are dominated by bulk materials such as sand and gravel, which require considerable area and often signify a considerable impact on the environment. Hence, a similar correlation as in the case of metals could have been expected.',

The elimination of discriminatory laws and policies reduce inequalities of outcome. In 72 countries, young people under a certain age must seek parental consent before accessing one or more SRHR service. Such policies have been widely condemned by the global health community, including the Committee on the Rights of the Child, and act as a significant barrier to young people's access to care. Globally, 44% of new HIV infections occur in key populations - sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people and men who have sex with men - and their sexual partners.

A possible outcome of increased cycling is a rise in cycling deaths, particularly if the increase is not accompanied by sufficient investment in safe infrastructure (e.g. segregated cycle highways).

Respondents built on this example by highlighting the wider potential health impacts of renewable technology supply chains (e.g. Li-Ion batteries, solar PV, electrolysers and CO2 leaks from Carbon Capture and Storage [CCS]), although, perhaps with the exception of CCS, noted that these are often outside of the UK. An additional point worth mentioning regards concern around future adaptation in sectors such as arable farming, where genetic modification decisions could impact human health in ways that are yet unknown. Some forms of renewable energy, such as bioenergy, have the capacity to damage environmental and human health if improperly managed. Chemicals in low-carbon technologies and involved in their manufacture e.g. Li-ion batteries, solar PV, electrolysers could leak into environment if not well managed. Adaptation using GM crops could have negative consequences if improperly tested / regulated. CO2 from CCS leaks could be a powerful pollutant.

Lifestyle changes, the increased deployment of renewable energy and improvements in resource efficiency, supported by suitable climate action policy, will lower resource demand as well as rates of environmental degradation Certain climate change mitigation measures, such as energy efficiency improvements, can also result in improved productivity (and therefore economic growth).  // No known trade- offs, only potential: Measures which effectively decoupled emissions and economic growth could simply lead to the offshoring of emissions elsewhere. [...] despite international emissions accounting frameworks this is still a very real risk in terms of domestic greenhouse emission reductions. [...] the risks of offshoring must be properly incorporated into policy assessment and design. Secondly, certain high carbon UK sectors that pose an inverse correlation risk, such as agriculture, where growth of the sector may actually drive environmental degradation [...] although future technological developments promise to reduce the carbon intensity and environmental damage caused by operations within these sectors, there are questions around when these will reach technological readiness and the environmental impact of growth in high carbon sectors in the interim. [...] without some shift away from orthodox economic thinking, growth and environmental degradation cannot be decoupled. [...] there may be some very real but as-yet unknown non-energy impacts of improving resource efficiency through climate policies. For example, as energy efficiency improves people may consume more, resulting in negative impacts outside of energy (e.g. land use, water or wider environment). Decarbonising certain industries is likely to have considerable impacts in terms of unemployment. Where no alternative, state-funded retraining is provided, there is a risk that such climate action works against job security and economic growth.  There is a risk that measures to decouple economic growth and emissions in the UK, without due accounting for supply chain emissions (as currently under discussed at UNFCCC, for example) will simply offshore emissions to other countries.  It may be that we cannot achieve the necessary degree of climate action whilst pursuing current rates of economic growth.  Economic growth, especially in the UK agricultural sector is a significant driver of environmental degradation.  The Jevons paradox/rebound effect - even as we become more efficient in our technologies and reduce energy demand, there may be some unforeseen impact of no longer constrained consumption.

Developing climate policy is likely to act as a stimulus for research in this area. // TRADE-OFFS: Overtly national decarbonization focus risks limiting international cooperation. It is important that RD&D is funded across the full spectrum of technology costs, so as to prevent exacerbating socio-economic inequalities, or the monopolisation of climate critical technologies amongst a few large actors.  Ownership and control of patents of these technologies should be shared equitably, rather than used to monopolise renewable energy tech no log ies/technology access.  Spending on RD&D could divert money from implementing known solutions. Innovation doesn't just happen in clean technologies, but also for fossil fuels, e.g. UK shale in recent years.

          "SYNERGIES: Policies which promote climate action are likely to improve global resource efficiency in consumption and production, such as the use of bioenergy systems which reduce food waste whilst generating low carbon heat and power. Lifestyle changes, the increased deployment of renewable energy and improvements in resource efficiency, supported by suitable climate action policy, will lower resource demand as well as rates of environmental degradation Certain climate change mitigation measures, such as energy efficiency improvements, can also result in improved productivity (and therefore economic growth).  // No known trade- offs, only potential: Measures which effectively decoupled emissions and economic growth could simply lead to the offshoring of emissions elsewhere. [...] despite international emissions accounting frameworks this is still a very real risk in terms of domestic greenhouse emission reductions. [...] the risks of offshoring must be properly incorporated into policy assessment and design. Secondly, certain high carbon UK sectors that pose an inverse correlation risk, such as agriculture, where growth of the sector may actually drive environmental degradation [...] although future technological developments promise to reduce the carbon intensity and environmental damage caused by operations within these sectors, there are questions around when these will reach technological readiness and the environmental impact of growth in high carbon sectors in the interim. [...] without some shift away from orthodox economic thinking, growth and environmental degradation cannot be decoupled. [...] there may be some very real but as-yet unknown non-energy impacts of improving resource efficiency through climate policies. For example, as energy efficiency improves people may consume more, resulting in negative impacts outside of energy (e.g. land use, water or wider environment). Decarbonising certain industries is likely to have considerable impacts in terms of unemployment. Where no alternative, state-funded retraining is provided, there is a risk that such climate action works against job security and economic growth.  There is a risk that measures to decouple economic growth and emissions in the UK, without due accounting for supply chain emissions (as currently under discussed at UNFCCC, for example) will simply offshore emissions to other countries.  It may be that we cannot achieve the necessary degree of climate action whilst pursuing current rates of economic growth.  Economic growth, especially in the UK agricultural sector is a significant driver of environmental degradation.  The Jevons paradox/rebound effect - even as we become more efficient in our technologies and reduce energy demand, there may be some unforeseen impact of no longer constrained consumption.  It's not clear that, the more efficiently we use resources the lower consumption rates will be. In fact, if improved efficiency= economic growth then consumption is likely to increase. This must be managed by intelligent policy design and behavioural shifts.",

A [...] potential explanation could be the fact that legislation aimed at Invasive alien species (IAS) control is often only brought in at the point where IAS have become a threat, which would make consequent trends in extinction risk extremely challenging to reverse.',
